### "We Cannot Solve Our Problems With The Same Thinking We Used When We Created Them."

#### â€” Albert Einstein

## How we usually find solutions and why this is problematic?

- We search for code example instead of algorithms.
- We copy and paste and do testing on trial&error principle.
- We don't take enough time to properly understand problem we a re trying to solve.
- Brute force solutions we make are usually not optimized

## Math is horrible and I don't need it!

- Well, YES :) Math can be horrible but also beautiful to implement.
- Disregarding math is disregarding thousands of years of knowledge.
- Math is not only for scientists.
- Good algorithm is as optimized as your code is when you are done with it.
- Math is the search for patterns and anti-patterns in natural universe and making these findings into tools accessible to ordinary people.

## Coordinate Geometry

A coordinate geometry is a branch of geometry where the position of the points on the plane is defined with the help of an ordered pair of numbers also known as coordinates.

## Vectors and spaces

- Space vector also called linear vector
- Vector = magnitude + direction
- Example: velocity vector (5kmh/west)

## Shortest path problem

In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.

Shortest path (A, C, E, D, F) between vertices A and F in the weighted directed graph
