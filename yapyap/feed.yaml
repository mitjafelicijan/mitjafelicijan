      Containers are wonderful, but they come with a lot of baggage. And because they are in their nature layered, the images require quite a lot of space and also a lot of additional software to handle them. They are not as lightweight as they seem, and many popular images require 500 MB plus disk space.
      The idea of running this as PID 1 would result in a significantly smaller footprint, as we will see later in the post.

      A while ago I bought a small eInk display Inky pHAT and I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's Zero lying around that I really need to use.
      A cool, simple evening project using some of the parts I had lying at home.
