      <title>I have started playing Torchlight 2 again. Forgot how much fun this game actually is. Since I am working on my own game in my spare time, it's interesting to see how they managed to keep their systems simple, yet interesting. Still have no idea if there is end-game, but leveling up is for sure fun.</title>

      <title>I started work on a hobby project that uses Gtk4 to display various data like CSV, SQLite, MySQL and Redis. Essentially, a data exploration tool with some plotting features.</title>

      <title>I added comments to my site finally. I choose https://cactus.chat/. Really simple implementation and uses Matrix protocol, which makes it even more cool. ðŸŽ‰</title>

      <title>I have been testing ideas how to implement microblogging as a replacement for Twitter. Using XSL and XML is an interesting idea that is supported through major browser. View the source of this page and check it out in action.</title>
