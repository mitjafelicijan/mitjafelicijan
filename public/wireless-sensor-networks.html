can reorder connections between them if one of them is inoperable. This works
our of the box when you deploy them. But you have to have in mind that achieving
this is not as easy as you would think. None of it is plug&amp;play. So to make
your life a bit easier, here are some pointers which, I hope, will help you.<ul><li>Be careful when you are ordering your equipment abroad. There are many rules
and regulations you need to comply before you get your Xbee radios. What they
do is they wait until you prove that you won’t use the technology for some
kind of evil take over control of the world project :). For this, they have
EAR (Export Administration Regulations) which basically means “This product
may require a license to export from the United States.”.<li>I don’t know if this applies for every country, but when we purchased our Xbee
radios from Mouser, this was mandatory! What we needed to do was to print out
a form and write information about our company and send them a copy via
email. With this document, we proved that we are a legitimate company.<li>When you complete your purchase and send all the documentation, you are not
clear yet. Then customs will take it from there :). There will be some
additional costs. Before purchasing, make sure you have as much information
about costs as possible. Because it can get costly in the end.<li>I suggest you use companies from your country. You can seriously cut your
costs. Here in Slovenia, the best option so far as I know is Farnell. And
based on my personal experience, they rock! All I need to say!<li>Make plans when ordering larger quantities. Do not, I say, do not make your
orders in December! :) Believe me! You will have problems with stock they can
provide for you. So, we were forced to buy some things from Mouser, which was
extremely painful because of all the regulations you need to obey when
importing goods from the USA.<li>Make sure that firmware version on your Xbee radios is exactly the same! Do
not get creative!!! I propose using templates. You can get template by
exporting settings/profile in X-CTU application. Make sure you have enabled
“Upgrade firmware” so you can be sure each radio has the same firmware.<li>And again: make plans! Plan everything! In months advanced! You will thank me
later :)<li>Test, test, test. Wireless networks can be tricky.</ul><p>If you are serious, I suggest you buy this book, Building Wireless Sensor
Networks. You will get a glimpse of how networks work in lumens terms. It is a
good starting point for everybody who wants to build wireless networks.<p><strong>Additional resources:</strong><ul><li><a href=http://www.digi.com/aboutus/export/generalexportinfo>http://www.digi.com/aboutus/export/generalexportinfo</a><li><a href=http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-scholarship/export-controls/export-controlled-or-embargoed-countries-entities-and-persons>http://doresearch.stanford.edu/research-scholarship/export-controls/export-controlled-or-embargoed-countries-entities-and-persons</a><li><a href=http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm>http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm</a></ul></div></div></main><footer><hr><div><h3>Want to comment or have something to add?</h3>You can write me an email at
