the main reasons was that I wanted something that doesn't burn through CPU and
RAM usage is not through the roof. I have been mostly using Visual Studio Code.
It's been an outstanding editor. I have no quarrel with it at all. It's just
time to spice life up with something new.<p>I have been on this search for a couple of years. I have tried Vim, Neovim,
Emacs, Doom Emacs, Micro and couple more. Among most of them, I liked Micro and
Doom Emacs the most. Micro editor was a little too basic for me. And Doom Emacs
was a bit too hardcore. This does not reflect on any of the editors. It's just
my personal preference.<blockquote><p>I tried Helix Editor about a year ago. But I didn't pay attention to it.
Tried it and saw it's similar to Vi and just said no. I was premature to
dismiss it.</blockquote><p>One of the things I actually miss is line wrapping for certain files. When
writing Markdown, line wrapping would be very helpful. Editing such a document
is frustrating to say the least. Some of the Markdown to HTML converters don't
take kindly of new lines between sentences. Not paragraphs, sentences. And I use
Markdown to write this blog you are reading.<p>But other than this, I have been extremely satisfied by it. It's been a pleasant
surprise. There have been zero issues with the editor.<p>One thing to do before you are able to use autocompletion and make use Language
Server support is to install the language server with NPM.<pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff><code><span style=display:flex><span>npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server
</span></span></code></pre><p>I am still getting used to the keyboard shortcuts and getting better. What Helix
does really well is packing in sane defaults and even though because currently
there is no plugin support I haven't found any need for them. It has all that
you would need. It goes to extreme measures to show a user what is going on with
popups that show you what the keyboard shortcuts are.<p>And it comes us packed with many
<a href=https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Themes>really good themes</a>.<p><img src=/assets/helix-editor/editor.png alt=Editor><p>It's still young but has this mature feeling to it. It has sane defaults and
mimics Vim (works a bit differently, but the overall idea is similar).</div></div></main><footer><hr><div><h3>Want to comment or have something to add?</h3>You can write me an email at
