description: Basic rules every developer should follow

Rules I accumulated and abided by over the years.

1. Follow Occam's razor whenever you can.
2. Early optimization is the root of all evil.
3. Always be transparent and truthful.
4. Focus on little incremental steps.
5. Document everything and follow standards.
